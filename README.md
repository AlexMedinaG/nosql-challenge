I explored a database called "uk_food" and its collection named "establishments" to practice reading a Mongo database, adding and modifying establishments, and working with the data to gain insights. During the process, I performed various tasks such as retrieving establishments with a hygiene score equal to the highest value, finding the best-rated establishments, etc.
